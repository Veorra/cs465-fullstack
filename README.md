Fullstack with the MEAN stack

Architecture

    1) Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
    
Express HTML and Javascript and single page application were used in my full stack project. The frontend of the website used both html and JavaScript. The JavaScript was used for routes, controllers, and models.

    2) Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
The backend used NoSQL MongoDB in order to store information like login credentials, and trip data. As for the use of NoSQL it was because NoSQL doesnt use schemas therefore making it easier for users to store and modify data.


Functionality

    1) How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON differes from JavaScript due to JSON being used primarily for data storage. JSON cannot include functions within its files therefore only storing data like the trip information in this project. JSON data is what is used to transmit data from the backend of the server to the frontend.
    
    2)Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

The main instance of refactored code would be the header and footer being made into partials for the Handlebars and could be called in a file to have them
display.

Testing

    1) Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

API endpoints in this application were used to validate the user and authorize the user to alter the information in the database. These endpoints are also used in combination with certain data related methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Applying security for these endpoints is essential because if there are no security protection features, unauthorized users would be able to make access of them and gain access to all the information held inside the database.

Reflection

    1) How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
    
This course has helped me in my professional development in understanding backend and frontend technologies. Furthermore I have developed a better understanding of html, css, and javascript. In addition to Express, Node.js, and Angular.

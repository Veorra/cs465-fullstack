Fullstack wiith the MEAN stack

Architecture

    1) Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
    
Express HTML and Javascript and single page application were used in my full stack project. The frontend of the website used both html and JavaScript. The JavaScript was used for routes, controllers, and models.

    2) Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
The backend used NoSQL MongoDB in order to store information like login credentials, and trip data. As for the use of NoSQL it was because NoSQL doesnt use schemas therefore making it easier for users to store and modify data.


Functionality

    2) How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
    Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Testing

    3) Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Reflection

    4) How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
